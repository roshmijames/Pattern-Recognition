# Pattern-Recognition
Four noise classifiers Gaussian Mixture Model, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN) were analyzed. The best configurations of the above that generated the best confusion matrices or the lowest probability of error within a time budget of 100 msec on a typical laptop/PC platform with a 2GHz processor was obtained by extensive analysis by changing parameters and configurations and by examining performance accuracy and error rate. It was tested for classification ofthree commonly encountered noise environments (Machinery, Street and Babble).
Four types of classifiers as different programs and has two sub programs as functions. These are .m programs(matlab).
